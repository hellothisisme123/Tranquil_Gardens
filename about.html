                    <p>Hello! My name is Kira Maree, the owner of Tranquil Gardens. I try to make sure there's a safe, fun, and productive workplace and store for everyone here. I've owned Tranquil for a while now and after a few bad years of learning we've really come up from our rough spot. I have a passion for gardening and love designing flower arrangements for everyone. I like to play casual dungeons and dragons with my friends and coworkers sometimes and it's really fun.</p>

I don't trust the school buses after my kids fell asleep and they got left there for 2 hours after school. I like spending time with my family when I get home.</p>
