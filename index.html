                <p>Our signiture formula allows our plants to grow free and healthy to last. When growing our plants we encourage care and love. You should be watering your plants daily for the first year and then you can let them grow through the rain alone. However during a drought, or a dry climate they might need some extra assistance. While we made the soil formula with natural fertilizers, using unatural won't necessarily harm the plant. Additional fertilizers aren't necessary either, unless someone mistakenly harms the plants, fertilizers are completely unnecessary. They might make the plant grow a bit fast if you're impatient but the plants will grow if given enought time. </p>

                <p>My grandfather started Tranquil Gardens using his inheritence money from the passing of his mother. He worked hard starting the gardens and cleaning up the empty lot. Since the pond isn't natural the early photos of the gardens are barely recognizable. It was also much smaller in the beginning and even if it was bigger he wouldn't have been able to plant anything in the space since he couldn've afford to pay employees. As he got older he wasn't able to work on the gardens as much and instead worked in the shop, pawning off the work to a few employees. When he passed away the business went down to my father and that's when the pond came to fruition. It was always my grandfathers dream to have a pond in the gardens but was never quite able to fund the construction of a man-made pond. My father had to close the gardens for about a month for the construction, along with building bridges and the gazebo. My father didn't make many more changes to the business besides expanding the selection of plants, selling mushrooms, along with seeds. He stopped wanting to do all the work associated with Tranquil so he decided it would be best to hand it off to me a few years back. </p>

                <h1 class="title">Pricing</h1>
                <p>We try to sell all our products to be affordable to everyone, but we simply cannot compete with some distributors without putting us at a significant loss crippling our business. We try to make up for that with high quality plants that you cant trust have had all the love and care they need during their first few days and weeks before you purchase. It takes years to grow some of our trees and countless manhours tending to them so we greatly appreciate all purchases. We also allow the public to do walkthroughs through our garden free of charge. Please throw away any trash and try not to step on any of the plants. We've had this garden since the beginning and we would love to keep it for years to come.</p>

                <h1 class="title">Refunds</h1>
                <p>We have certain plants marked with a sticker that means it is elligible for a refund if it dies within a certain period of time. This period is specified on the sticker. We have this because sometimes our plants get stepped on, or messed up in some way that could make it more difficult to grow them. We would still like to sell these plants however it would be unfair to not state that on sale, so we offer refunds for such items. We do not offer refunds for any other items with exceptions for extreme circumstances or mistakes by us. One example of this would be if you bought a tree and our driver dropped it on the way to the delivery location. </p>
